Using this simple random sample (SRS) size 80 sample, for each of the 5 quantitative variables MAGE, WEEKS, GAINED, TOUNCES, and TGRAMS:

SRS 80 

ncb <- NCBIRTH800 %>% slice_sample(replace=FALSE,n=80)

view(ncb)

ncbs80 <- ncb %>% select(mage,weeks,gained,tounces,tgrams)

view(ncbs80)
write.xlsx(ncbs80,file_path)



A) Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, and range
