## North Carolina State Center Birth Statistics Case Study

**Introduction**

The North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics and Howard W. Odum Institute for Research in 
Social Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill make publicly available birth and infant 
death data for all children born in the state of North Carolina. Records on birth data go back to 1968. 
This comprehensive data set for the births in 2001 contains 120,300 records. The data represents a 
random sample of 800 of those births and selected variables.

For this study we will extract a sample of 30 observations from the available 800 observations using **R**.

**Objectives**

Develop and interpret numeric and graphic descriptive statistics to describe the data, specifically
examining weeks of gestation, weight of child (in grams), and potential effect of smoking (status) on 
weight. Note that the following description of the data as to data type and unit of measure for each 
variable is critical to the analysis including choice of type of analysis

**Data Description**

<ins>Variable Label</ins> - <ins>Description

MAGE - Age of mother (years)

WEEKS - Completed weeks of gestation (weeks)

GAINED - Weight gained during pregnancy (pounds)

TOUNCES - Weight of child (ounces)

TGRAMS - Weight of child (grams)

**Case Study**

Draw a simple random sample (SRS) of size 80 from this 800 observation dataset for use in this assignment. You may want to save this sample for use in subsequent assignments as well as for backup for this unit. Using this SRS size 80 sample, for each of the 5 quantitative variables MAGE, WEEKS, GAINED, TOUNCES, and TGRAMS:

a) Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, and range.

b) Calculate the skew and kurtosis.

c) Construct a histogram and comment on the shape of the distribution.

d) Do the histograms for TOUNCES and TGRAMS look strikingly similar? Why?

e) Construct box-and-whisker plots.

f) Construct side-by-side box-and-whisker plots for the variable TGRAMS for women who admitted to smoking and for those who did not admit to smoking. Do you see a difference in birth weight (TGRAMS) in the two groups? Which group has more variability?
